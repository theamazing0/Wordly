Word Familiarity Data - https://websites.psychology.uwa.edu.au/school/MRCDatabase/uwa_mrc.htm - `is being provided for public research use along with some programs which can be used either to access the dictionary, or as examples on which to model programs which match users' specific needs. This database dictionary differs from other machine usable dictionaries in that it includes not only syntactic information but also psychological data for the entries (see Amsler, 1984 for a review of other machine-readable dictionaries). It also differs from most conventional dictionaries in that it does not currently attempt to provide any semantic information. It is designed to be of use to psycholinguists in selecting stimulus materials for testing; for use by researchers in Artificial Intelligence as a source of information required for natural language processing and cognitive simulation; and for use by computer scientists who wish to use the word lists and syntactic information in the design of text processors.  `
